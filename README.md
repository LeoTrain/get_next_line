This is the third project that I've chosen for the campus. Here the concept seems pretty easy to understand.
You have to create a function that returns a single line at the time from a ridden text file.

I wont go to deep in the details but a end of line would be seen as '\n' or EOF. It should also read from the standard input.
The return value will include the terminating '\n' character execpt in the case of an EOF.

Here I think, that I'll learn about static variables and how to attribute a value on the compilation (-D flag).
Reading a binary file, or didn't the '''read()''' method reach the end of the file, it exhibits an undefined bahavior.
